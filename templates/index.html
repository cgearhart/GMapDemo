                <p>This is a proof of concept visualization of a RESTful health monitoring API for the Tesla SuperCharger system, written in response to the job posting at <a href="http://ch.tbe.taleo.net/CH07/ats/careers/requisition.jsp;jsessionid=293A81224C0421722B0A2C9A01F9C306.NA10_primary_jvm?org=TESLA&cws=1&rid=12410">Tesla Careers</a>. The API is run on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (powered by <a href="http://django-rest-framework.org/">django-rest-framework</a> &amp; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ubernostrum/django-registration/">django-registration</a> for user management) and hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> running a <a href="https://postgres.heroku.com/">PostGreSQL</a> database.The visualization relies on a small javascript file, hosted on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon s3</a> (along with static files for the other libraries), to plot the location of <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger">SuperCharger stations</a>, color coded for simulated health condition (green for 'Operational', blue for 'Scheduled Maintenance', yellow for 'Unscheduled Maintenance', and red for 'Offline'). It took a few hours to implement and debug. With appropriate account credentials, the API is actually <a href="http://teslascdemo.herokuapp.com/stations/">already functional</a>; the database schema is not well-defined for complete health monitoring, but it demonstrates the intended functionality. There are endpoints for <a href="http://teslascdemo.herokuapp.com/accounts/register/">Creating User Accounts</a> & <a href="http://teslascdemo.herokuapp.com/accounts/login">Login</a>, <a href="http://teslascdemo.herokuapp.com/admin/">Admin Control</a>, <a href="http://teslascdemo.herokuapp.com/stations/">POSTing/GETting supercharger stations</a>, and <a href="http://teslascdemo.herokuapp.com/events/">POSTing/GETting events on those stations</a> - with optional filtering on stations and events.</p>
                <p>As I began writing a cover letter to submit with my application, I decided that a demonstration would be more powerful than anything I could say. Sure, I've got a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in electromechanical systems (robotics). I've also got several years experience as an Operations Research Analyst and Systems Engineer for the US Navy (as a DoD civilian). But none of that shows that I can do what you're describing as well as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>
                <p>In short, I think we should talk. I'm excited about the job description, because I think I can help you build exactly what you need. In addition to programming ability, I believe that my experience as a systems engineer will provide clarity and focus on establishing design specifications, and my OR experience will be useful in modeling and understanding the SuperCharger network.</p>

                <p>Source code for this demonstration is available on <a href="https://github.com/cgearhart/teslascdemo">GitHub</a>, although I'll thank you kindly not to judge the code too harshly - I didn't put much work into commenting it.</a>
                <p>Thanks for your time.</p><br>
