                <p>This is a proof of concept visualization of a RESTful health monitoring API for the Tesla SuperCharger system, written in response to the job posting at <a href="http://ch.tbe.taleo.net/CH07/ats/careers/requisition.jsp;jsessionid=293A81224C0421722B0A2C9A01F9C306.NA10_primary_jvm?org=TESLA&cws=1&rid=12410">Tesla Careers</a>. The API is run on Django (powered by django-rest-framework & django-registration for user management) and hosted on Heroku running a PostGreSQL database.The visualization relies on a small javascript file, hosted on Amazon s3, to plot the location of SuperCharger stations, color coded for simulated health condition (green for 'Operational', blue for 'Scheduled Maintenance', yellow for 'Unscheduled Maintenance', and red for 'Offline'). It took a few hours to implement and debug. With appropriate account credentials, the API is actually <a href="http://teslascdemo.herokuapp.com/stations/">already functional</a>; the database schema is not well-defined for complete health monitoring, but it demonstrates the intended functionality.</p>
                <p>As I began writing a cover letter to submit with my application, I decided that a demonstration would be more powerful than anything I could say. Sure, I've got a BS in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in electromechanical systems (robotics). I've also got several years experience as an Operations Research Analyst and Systems Engineer for the US Navy (as a DoD civilian). But none of that shows that I can do what you're describing as well as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>
                <p>In short, I think we should talk. I'm excited about the job description, because I think I can help you build exactly what you need. In addition to programming ability, I believe that my experience as a systems engineer will provide clarity and focus on establishing design specifications, and my OR experience will be useful in modeling and understanding the SuperCharger network.</p>

                <p>Thanks for your time.</p><br>
